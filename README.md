## How It's Made:
HTML, CSS, & JavaScript

## Optimization:
I thought this would be easier than it was, seeing that tic-tac-toe seemed like a simple enough game. One of the biggest challenges was figuring out how to check each win. I started with multiple event listeners and if/else statements. That didn't seem to work. After days of research, my group and I figured an object would be the best route to be able to loop thru each square to check if it has a letter or not.

-I decided to leave my commented out original code to be transparent and remember my thought process and reflect on where it started vs the outcome.

## Lesson Learned:
This project introduced me to the for..in loops and how to work with it alongside event.target and event listeners. Aside from what I learned from the coding itself, I learned that bouncing ideas off of your team can really help you get to your solution quicker and with less head banging. Lean on your team because there is always more to learn & more than one way to find the solution
